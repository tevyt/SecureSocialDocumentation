Installing Plugin
-----------------
To install the latest version of SecureSocial in your application add the following line to your build.sbt 

.. code-block:: scala

    "ws.securesocial" %% "securesocial" % "master-SNAPSHOT"  

The SonaType resolver's also need to be added to build.sbt

.. code-block:: scala
    
    resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots")

Example build.sbt:

.. code-block:: scala
    
   name := """SecureSocialDemo2"""

   version := "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

   lazy val root = (project in file(".")).enablePlugins(PlayJava)

   scalaVersion := "2.11.1"

   libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
        javaJdbc,
        javaEbean,
        cache,
        javaWs,
        "ws.securesocial" %% "securesocial" % "master-SNAPSHOT",
        "postgresql" % "postgresql" % "9.1-901-1.jdbc4")

        resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots")
-------------
Adding routes
-------------
SecureSocial's routes need to be included in your applications routes file

.. code-block:: scala

   ->         /auth                securesocial.Routes

The line aboves uses the -> symbol to link SecureSocial's routes to your application.
