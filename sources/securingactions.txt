Securing Actions
================

To secure an action using SecureSocial simply use the annotation 

.. code-block:: java

   @SecuredAction

This annotation causes the route to redirect to the SecureSocial login page if a user is not currently logged in.

An example useage below

.. code-block:: java

   import securesocial.core.java.SecuredAction;

   @SecuredAction
   public static Result index(){
        return ok(index.render("Hello Secure World"));
   }
