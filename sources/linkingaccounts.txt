Linking Accounts
================

To link user accounts a second user account is simply authenticated while one is already logged in.

This can be done through the reverse route

.. code-block:: scala
   
   @env.routes.authenticationUrl(providerId , Some("route after link"))

Replacing providerId with the providerId of the provider you want to link and "url after link" with some route to visit after accounts have been linked
